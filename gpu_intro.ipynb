These threads are the smallest individual unit in the programming model, and they execute together in groups (traditionally called **warps**, consisting of 32 thread each). Determiming the best size for your grid of thread blocks is a complicated problem that often depends on the specific algorithm and hardware you're using, but here a few good rules of thumb:\n",
        "+ the size of a block should be a multiple of 32 threads, with typical block sizes between 128 and 512 threads per block.\n",
        "+ the size of the grid should ensure the full GPU is utilized where possible. Launching a grid where the number of blocks is 2x-4x the number of \"multiprocessors\" on the GPU is a good starting place. Something in the range of 20 - 100 blocks is usually a good starting point.\n",
        "+ The CUDA kernel launch overhead does depend on the number of blocks, so it may not be best to launch a grid where the number of threads equals the number of input elements when the input size is very big. We'll show a pattern for dealing with large inputs below.\n",

        "\n",
        "CUDA, like many general purpose parallel execution frameworks, makes it possible to have race conditions in your code. A race condition in CUDA arises when threads read or write a memory location that might be modified by another independent thread. Generally speaking, you need to worry about:\n",
        "+ read-after-write hazards: One thread is reading a memory location at the same time another thread might be writing to it.\n",
        "+ write-after-write hazards: Two threads are writing to the same memory location, and only one write will be visible when the kernel is complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "A common strategy to avoid both of these hazards is to organize your CUDA kernel algorithm such that each thread has exclusive responsibility for unique subsets of output array elements, and/or to never use the same array for both input and output in a single kernel call. (Iterative algorithms can use a double-buffering strategy if needed, and switch input and output arrays on each iteration.)\n",
        "However, there are many cases where different threads need to combine results. Consider something very simple, like: \"every thread increments a global counter.\" Implementing this in your kernel requires each thread to:\n",
        "1. Read the current value of a global counter.\n",
        "2. Compute counter + 1.\n",
        "3. Write that value back to global memory.\n",

To resolve this problem, CUDA provides \"atomic operations\" which will read, modify and update a memory location in one, indivisible step.
